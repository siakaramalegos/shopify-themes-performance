    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>This site was built to better inform Shopify merchants and theme developers about theme performance. The goals are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide <strong>theme developers</strong> with aggregated shop data so that they can understand how their theme is currently performing and which metrics need the most work.</li>
      <li>Provide <strong>merchants</strong> with aggregated theme data so that they can balance the tradeoffs between the features and performance of themes with their budget for custom theme development.</li>
    </ul>

      alt="The HTTP Archive Tracks How the Web is Built. We periodically crawl the top sites on the web and record detailed information about fetched resources, used web platform APIs and features, and execution traces of each page. We then crunch and analyze this data to identify trends."

      <div class="flow">
        <p>All of the data reported here is publicly available through <a href="https://httparchive.org/">HTTPArchive</a> and the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux">Chrome User Experience Report</a> (CrUX) via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a>. Information about whether a website is on Shopify and which theme it uses comes from HTTPArchive. That data is then joined with CrUX to obtain real-user performance metrics from sessions in Chrome browsers. You can find and review the query in this site's <a href="https://github.com/siakaramalegos/shopify-themes-performance/blob/main/query.sql">source code</a>.</p>
